**Pushing Together** is an open-source web platform to manage participative opinion research, 
with built-in machine learning algorithm to generate opinion groups from participation data. 
You can visit EJ at [https://www.ejplatform.org](https://www.ejplatform.org).
For detailed information on developing and using our system, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.ejplatform.org/docs/).
For contributions, issues or feature requests join us on [https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/ej/ej-application](https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/ej/ej-application).
The below steps works well with linux or Windows machine, for MacOS steps are mentioned below after **Tests**

# Getting started with Docker

**1. Clone de repository**
```sh
     git clone https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/ej/ej-application
     cd ej-application
```
**2. Install [docker compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/#install-using-the-repository)**

The following instructions works properly with compose plugin version `v2.21.0` and Docker Engine version `24.0`.

**3. Run inv tasks**
**Note** - inv coomand may not work on a python version above 3.10/3.11
```sh
     pip3 install invoke==2.0.0 django-environ --user
     inv docker-up
```
This will deploy EJ using **docker/docker-compose.yml** file.
Every code change will be synchronized with `docker_server` container. After `inv docker-up`, you can access EJ on `http://localhost:8000` url.

If you are creating a clean instance, you can populate the database with some fake data:
```sh
     inv docker-exec "inv db-fake"
```
Alternatively, if you wish to clean your database and repopulate it using the
script, you'll need to remove `docker_backups` volume.  After that, run `inv docker-up` command and then
`inv docker-exec "inv db-fake"`, as mentioned previously.

To rebuild the server image, you can run 'inv docker-build --no-cache'.

Some useful commands to manage docker environment:

| Command           | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| inv docker-up     | Creates EJ containers and run the application    |
| inv docker-build  | Builds EJ server Docker image                    |
| inv docker-logs   | Shows django logs                                |
| inv docker-stop   | Stops EJ containers                              |
| inv docker-rm     | Removes EJ containers                            |
| inv docker-attach | Connects to django container                     |
| inv docker-exec   | Executes a shell command inside django container |

Some useful commands to manage the application **(run this inside django container)**:

| Command          | Description                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| inv i18n         | Extracts messages from Jinja templates for translation         |
| inv i18n -c      | Compile .po files                                              |
| inv sass         | Compile .sass files for all EJ apps.                           |
| inv sass --watch | Watch changes on code, and compile .sass files for all EJ apps |
| inv collect      | Moves compiled files (css, js) to Django static folder         |
| inv db           | Prepare database and run migrations                            |
| inv shell        | Executes django shell with ipython                             |
| inv docs         | Compile .rst documentation to generates .html files            |

## MacOS 

If you are using a Mac on intel chip the above process may work for you, if not you can follow the same steps as below.

You will have to setup a virtual machine (Linux), prefer UTM for apple silicon as virtual box for apple silicon is still unstable and crash every 15 min as of May2024.
If want to setup a virtual machine on intel chip mac , even Virtual box is good choice.
Follow "https://dev.to/ruanbekker/how-to-run-a-amd64-bit-linux-vm-on-a-mac-m1-51cp", for VM setup. Then normally download all dependency(git,python,Pip,docker,code-editor) on virtual device. 
1. Clone branch upgrade-to-python-39
```sh
git clone --branch upgrade-to-python-39 https://gitlab.com/pencillabs/ej/ej-application.git
```
2. To setup the docker [Docker compose Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#installation-methods)
3. Install invoke and django environment 
```sh
    pip3 install invoke==2.0.0 django-environ --user
```
- May be below command won't work directly into your virtual machine due to permission of root user access. Then in that case use :
```sh
    sudo python3 -m pip install invoke==2.0.0 django-environ
```
4. Run a docker command before final build 
```python
    docker-build --no-cache  
```
5. Run inv tasks for final build
```sh
     inv docker-up
```

# Tests

If you are making changes to EJ codebase, do not forget to run tests frequently.
EJ uses Pytest:
```sh/terminal
     inv docker-test
```
Beyond unit and integration tests, EJ also has e2e tests implemented with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
Check `src/ej/tests/e2e/README.md` for more informations.


# API

EJ API autogenerated documentation and endpoints 
will be available at [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/swagger/](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/swagger/).

# Documentation

After configuring local environment, the next step is reading our documentation. It can be generated with:
```python
     inv docker-exec "inv docs"
```
and will be available at the [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) url.
